Project Objectives
The primary objective of the Disaster Aid Platform is to provide users with real-time information about disaster-related events, empowering communities and individuals to stay informed and act quickly during emergencies. By centralizing disaster-related data such as news updates, user reports, and alerts for missing persons, the platform fosters better situational awareness and encourages prompt, coordinated responses.
Users can leverage interactive maps and geolocation features to filter and sort ongoing events based on relevance, date, or proximity to their location. The platform also supports searching for specific events in particular regions.

Project Features
Real-Time Event Updates: Users receive continuous updates on ongoing disaster-related events like news, user-generated reports, and alerts about missing persons.
Geolocation and Mapping: The app detects the user's location and displays nearby events on an interactive map, allowing for quick identification of relevant situations.
Filter and Sorting: Events can be filtered by categories (e.g., news, user reports, missing persons) and sorted by relevance, time of occurrence, or popularity.
Search Functionality: Users can search for specific events or news updates related to particular locations to gain tailored information about disasters.
User Contributions: Users can submit reports or information directly to the platform, contributing to real-time updates for other users.
Alerts and Notifications: Immediate notifications and alerts for significant or critical events, such as missing persons or urgent news.
