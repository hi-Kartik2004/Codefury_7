Here's a brief description of your application:

Application Overview:

Our application is designed to enhance disaster preparedness and response by providing users with real-time information about ongoing events such as news updates, user reports, and alerts about missing persons. Leveraging geolocation technology, the app identifies the userâ€™s current location and displays the nearest events on an interactive map. Users can filter these events by type (e.g., news, user reports, lost people) and sort them based on relevance, date, or popularity. The search functionality allows users to look up specific events or news related to particular locations. By offering a centralized platform for disaster-related information, our app empowers individuals and communities to stay informed and act quickly during emergencies. This solution not only improves situational awareness but also facilitates faster and more coordinated responses to disasters.
